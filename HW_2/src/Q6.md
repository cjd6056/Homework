# Question 6
# Prompt: From Question 03, what issues you might obtain during the development of the program? What issues do you think will happen if some of the actions, e.g., waking up the ATC, checking the traffic pattern, entering the traffic pattern, diverging to another airport, etc., take time to finish? And whatwill be a potential solution for the issues? Note: The code is optional for this question. You can submit the discussion as a markdown file.

To mitigate these issues, tasks can be optimized for faster execution, and asynchronous processing can be employed. 
By allowing certain tasks (e.g., waiting for ATC, checking the traffic pattern) to run in parallel while other actions 
are taking place, we can reduce delays and maintain a smooth flow of operations. This approach minimizes the idle time 
of threads, allowing the system to continue processing without unnecessary waits, similar to how the sleeping barber 
would efficiently serve customers without idling unnecessarily.
