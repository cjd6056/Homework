# Question 5
# From Question 02, what issues may happen if the robot that finished the task is assigned a new task immediately? And what will be a potential solution for the issues? Note: The code is optional for this question. You can submit the discussion as a markdown file. HINT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem




One simple solution is to add a small delay between tasks, so the robot waits until the tools are available. 
However, this isnâ€™t the best solution because it wastes time. A better solution is to ensure that robots 
always grab the tools in the same order, preventing any deadlock (where robots get stuck waiting forever). 
Another option is to make robots check if the tools are available before starting a task.

Whatever the solution, robots should finish their tasks without waiting too long or getting stuck, improving efficiency.
